This software was created by an AuDHD creator to help others who struggle with 
listing items online. The AI prompts, UX patterns, and methodologies represent 
substantial proprietary intellectual property developed with care for the 
neurodivergent community.

Unauthorized commercial use undermines the creator's livelihood and the spirit 
of community support that this project embodies. Such use will be pursued to 
the fullest extent of the law.
