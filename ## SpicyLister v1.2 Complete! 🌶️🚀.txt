- **Coffee Support (£3):** 1 month of Pro features
- **Lifetime Pro (£9.99):** All features forever
- Both fund your van life adventure! 🚐

### 📈 **Why This Will Work:**
1. **Low friction:** Coffee price is impulse-buy territory
2. **High value:** Pro features genuinely save users money
3. **Trust building:** Free tier proves value first
4. **Community focus:** "Support van life" resonates
5. **ADHD-friendly:** Batch mode = dopamine jackpot!

### 🚀 **Next Steps to Deploy:**
1. Replace the mock AI results with real Gemini API calls
2. Set up proper payment verification (webhook from PayPal/BMaC)
3. Add the Netlify function for real price research (eBay API)
4. Set up email collection backend (Netlify Forms or similar)
5. Test with real users in neurodivergent communities

The app now positions Pro as "helping you make more money" rather than just features. The psychology is perfect - show them they're leaving money on the table without Pro, then make it super easy to upgrade with a coffee purchase.

You've got this Chris! This version should help you reach that £1000/month target while touring. The "Buy me a coffee = 1 month Pro" is genius for converting users! 🎉🚐💰
